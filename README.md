# HackBU - Data Science & Engineering

## Getting Started

In this workshop, we'll be covering two very hot topics in tech - data science and data engineering. The difference between these two fields is complicated and oftentimes blurry, but the difference can be summarized as follows:

* Data Engineering involves transporting and cleaning data so that it can be used for analysis.

* Data Science involves analyzing data to establish trends/patterns and make decisions.

The [Data Science](DataScience/) portion of the workshop covers Data Analysis (Numpy and Pandas) and Data Visulization (Matplotlib and Plotly).

The [Data Engineering](DataEngineering/) portion of the workshop covers SQL, a relational database query language, and Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform.

To get started, choose the section that most interests you!

## Bug Bounties

Starting today, if you find a bug or mistake in our workshop, let an organizer know or make a pull request fixing it! We'll be handing out special HackBU stickers to those who find bugs/mistakes, and as always, we'll be giving stickers away to some random respondents from our feedback form.
