# Data Engineering

To start out, check out the [SQL introduction](SQLIntroduction.md)! The introduction provides valuable information pertaining to what SQL is all about and its various uses in real-world workplaces. *fit the paragraph description to the contents after it is completed and make sure file is linked properly*

If you haven't worked with SQL before, check out the [beginner SQL section](SQLBeginner.md). This section covers SQL syntax and how to create queries using **select** statements. Select statements are arguably the most important aspect of SQL. Select statements make use of logical operators, grouping, and ordering to filter out data and obtain the intended information from a database table.

For those who may already feel comfortable with the basics of SQL and select statements, we invite you to check out the [intermediate SQL section](SQLIntermediate.md). This section will cover more advanced select statements that use **joins** and how to create functions in SQL. Joins are very useful for retreiving data from multiple database tables and combining or computing new values using the information gathered.

Lastly, if you are already experienced in SQL and data retrieval, check out the [advanced SQL section](SQLAdvanced.md). This section covers database table creation and management, as well as a glimpse into stored procedures. In order to perform the queries in the beginner and intermediate sections, it is important to understand how the databases themselves are maintained and updated!
