## Plotly Python Graphing Library

Hello Hackers! Today we'll be going over some of the basics on how to use Plotly, an open source Python graphing library. Designed for
statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases, Plotly allows you to make extremely elaborate and professional
charts. 

If you've never worked in Python before or haven't touched the language in a while, we'd recommend you scroll through the beginner section 
of our [Python workshop](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop) as a refresher before beginning this section of the workshop.

# Important First Steps

Before beginning our Plotly journey, we need to install Plotly.

The easiest way to do this is to install Python, then Pip, then call `pip install plotly==4.1.0`.

If you need help with this, throw your hands up and an organizer will find you.

# Using Plotly

To use Plotly now that it's installed, open a Python file and add the import statement `import plotly.graph_objects as go`.
