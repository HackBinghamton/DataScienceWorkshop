## Database and Database Management Systems
Databases store a collection of data. Using database management systems, users can access databases, modify, manipulate, and represent the data stored in the database.

One type of database management system is the relational database management system (RDBMS). Relational means that data has relationship with other data in the database. Most often, a relational database stores data in tables consisting of rows and columns. Popular RDBMS's are Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and oracle.

## What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language (pronounced as "sequel" or "S-Q-L"). It is a programming language used to access relational databases.

SQL syntax between DBMS are very similar, but there are slight differences. This workshop will be using syntax for a popular RDBMS: Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL Server).

## SQL Uses and Applications
#### Uses
SQL has four main uses as a Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Transaction Control Language (TCL), and Data Control Language (DCL).

SQL as a Data Definition Language defines databases and labels data with additional properties.

SQL as a Data Manipulation Language manages data in the database.

SQL as a Transaction Control Language manages transaction made in the database, such as any changes to the database from DML statements.

SQL as a Data Control Language controls accesses to databases.

#### Applications
SQL programming language can be used with anything that uses databases. A few example are:

* health care - patient records
* business - trends, sales, inventory
* website displaying analyzed data
