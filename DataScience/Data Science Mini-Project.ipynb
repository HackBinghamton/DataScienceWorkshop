    "Given the information from the previous section, you should be equipped to read data from formats such as JSON, CSV files, etc. into pandas dataframes. Dataframes allow us to analyze and interpret large amounts of data. For this mini-project, we'll be looking at data from a website called kaggle.com. Kaggle is a pretty awesome resource for all things data science, as they host public datasets, competitiheons, and tutorials. Their competitions tend to dea, with solving real-world problems, for example, they're currently running a competition for determining ways to deal with Los Angeles' hiring crisis as their workforce retires (https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles), and one for using news to predict stock prices (https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news).\n",

    "Because we want to recognize that not everyone will be interested in the same topics, we want to leave this project open-ended. In this example, we'll take a look at a CSV file pertaining to the success of different climbing routes on Mount Rainier, but, if this sounds boring or unappealing, we encourage you to search around and find a different dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Our Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to look at the data from previous Mt Rainier climbs, and use it to determine which route is the safest. While this may sound trivial, we should note that the data is separated by year. So, one route may have had a 100% success rate one year, despite not being the safest. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Bonus\n",
    "How could we adjust our results to control for weather variation? We have access to the weather during each year.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The data files should be available in the Github repo. However, if they are not, here's a link to the CSV file(s) we'll be using (https://www.kaggle.com/codersree/mount-rainier-weather-and-climbing-data). For our mini-project, we'll only be looking at the climbing statistics for the base project, and the weather data for the bonus. Our first step will be to load the data in from the CSV, into a dataframe. \n",
