    "Given the information from the previous sections, you should be equipped to read data into Pandas dataframes. Dataframes allow us to analyze and interpret large amounts of data. For this mini-project, we'll be looking at data from a website called kaggle.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle is an awesome resource for all things data science, as they host public datasets, competitions, and tutorials. Their competitions tend to deal with solving real-world problems, for example, last year they ran a competition for determining ways to deal with Los Angeles' hiring crisis as their workforce retires (https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-city-of-los-angeles), and one for using news to predict stock prices (https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For today's mini-project, we are going to look at a dataset fom Kaggle, and using Pandas to structure, visualize, and interpret it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to recognize that not everyone will be interested in the same topics, we want to leave this project open-ended. In this example, we'll take a look at a CSV file pertaining to the success of different climbing routes on Mount Rainier, but, if this sounds boring or unappealing, we encourage you to search around and find a different dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to look at the data from previous Mt Rainier climbs, and use it to **determine which route is the safest**. While this may sound trivial, we should note that the data is separated by year. So, one route may have had a 100% success rate one year, despite not being the safest. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The data files should be available in the Github repo, and we'll do the work of importing them for you below. For our mini-project, we'll only be looking at the climbing statistics for the base project, and the weather data for the bonus. Our first step will be to load the data in from the CSV, into a dataframe. \n",
