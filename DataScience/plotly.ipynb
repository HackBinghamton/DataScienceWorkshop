    "Hello Hackers! Today we'll be going over some of the basics on how to use Plotly, an open source Python graphing library. Designed for statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases, Plotly allows you to make extremely elaborate and professional charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never worked in Python before or haven't touched the language in a while, we'd recommend you scroll through the beginner section of our [Python workshop](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop) as a refresher before beginning this section of the workshop.\n"

While we will not be discussing renderers in greater detail today, you can learn more in [Plotly's documentation.](https://plot.ly/python/renderers/#overriding-the-default-renderer)"

    "\n",
    "When storing our data as a dictionary, we need the key \"type\" pointed to one of Plotly's 40 chart methods. In this example, we are using a bar graph, so we also need the keys \"x\" and \"y\" to hold the data displayed in our bar graph. After adding our data to the dictionary, we can render the chart using the `.show()` function."
